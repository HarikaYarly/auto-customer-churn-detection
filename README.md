# auto-customer-churn-detection

Due to having large files, we were facing issues uploading the files to github. We tried git lfs, but unfotunately that is not possible as we ran out of bandwidth which git lfs allows for free. That is why we have shared the google colab link here : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fduj7JvVfu-qfkutYY1ZBalWdo5RNEbt?usp=sharing

This is a team project.
